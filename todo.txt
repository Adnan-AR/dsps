> Env variables to be configured
    - NODE_CONFIG_PATH: path to node configuration file
    - $BEAM_PORT_MIN and $BEAM_PORT_MAX


> In mix.exs (config provider):
   - We should find a solution to load env var NODE_CONFIG_PATH
   in the runtime and not during the buildtime

> ALL nodes should be started before the master (To fix that)
